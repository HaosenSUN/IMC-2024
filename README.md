# IMC-2024
This is the solution we provided for the [_"Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Hexathlon"_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2024) Kaggle competition, where we won a **silver medal** (ranked **28/929**).

## Algorithm Descriptions

1. **Retrieval**: Retrieval for various 3D scene image datasets, using pretrained model weights of Efficientnet-b6&b7 from ImageNet to extract image data features. The selection is based on cosine distance, ranking the top n images in each scene dataset by similarity.
2. **Image Feature Keypoint Extraction and Matching**:
  - For the retrieved image library, use korniaâ€™s corner feature detector CornerGFTT to extract relevant feature point locations. The AdaLAM algorithm is applied to calculate matches for all matching points, saving successful match pairs.
  - For the retrieved image library, use SuperPoint to extract relevant feature point locations. The SuperGlue algorithm is applied to calculate matches for all matching points, saving successful match pairs.
3. **Spatial Position Estimation**: Combine the successful match pairs from both processes of the image library, removing duplicates, and input into pycolmap to compute the final 3D spatial relationships (position and pose estimation).
